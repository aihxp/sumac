# CLI -> AI Surfaces

This document turns the `CLI -> AI surfaces` idea into a concrete product model
for `sxmc`.

Current shipped path:

```bash
sxmc inspect cli gh --format toon
sxmc init ai --from-cli gh --client claude-code --mode preview
sxmc init ai --from-cli gh --coverage full --mode preview
sxmc init ai --from-cli gh --coverage full --host claude-code,cursor --mode apply
sxmc inspect profile examples/profiles/from_cli.json --format toon
sxmc inspect profile examples/profiles/from_generated_cli.json --pretty
```

That keeps JSON as the canonical profile format while allowing a more compact,
TOON-style view when you want to inspect large profiles quickly.

## Goal

Take a real CLI or a generated CLI wrapper, inspect it into a normalized JSON
profile, and generate agent-ready scaffolds from that profile.

## What Counts As An AI Surface

`AI surfaces` in `sxmc` should stay intentionally small and explicit.

Supported target surface types:

- `skill_markdown`
  - a `SKILL.md`-style artifact
- `agent_doc_snippet`
  - a suggested block for files like `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, or similar
- `mcp_wrapper_scaffold`
  - a scaffold for turning the CLI into an MCP-facing wrapper
- `client_config_snippet`
  - a small example block for a client or agent setup file

Current full-coverage host outputs:

- portable `AGENTS.md`
- `CLAUDE.md`
- `.cursor/rules/sxmc-cli-ai.md`
- `GEMINI.md`
- `.github/copilot-instructions.md`
- `.continue/rules/sxmc-cli-ai.md`
- `opencode.json`
- `.aiassistant/rules/sxmc-cli-ai.md`
- `.junie/guidelines.md`
- `.windsurf/rules/sxmc-cli-ai.md`
- host config scaffolds for Claude Code, Cursor, Gemini CLI, OpenAI/Codex, and generic stdio/http MCP

Out of scope by default:

- rewriting an entire existing `AGENTS.md` / `CLAUDE.md`
- autonomous multi-file project refactors
- automatic commits of generated docs without review

## Pipeline Model

The intended pipeline is:

```text
real CLI -> normalized JSON profile -> chosen AI surface(s)
```

Concrete shipped pipeline:

```text
CLI binary
  -> sxmc inspect cli <command>
  -> JSON profile
  -> sxmc init ai / sxmc scaffold ...
  -> startup-ready AI files
```

### Stage 1: `sxmc inspect cli <command>`

`inspect cli` runs a real CLI, reads its help surface, and normalizes that into
the canonical JSON profile.

The profile is designed to capture things agents and startup docs actually need:

| Field area | What it captures |
|---|---|
| `summary` / `description` | high-level purpose and one-line description |
| `subcommands` | names, summaries, and confidence levels |
| `options` | long flags, short flags, value names, and required/optional hints |
| `examples` | usage examples recovered from help text |
| `environment` | auth or env requirements when they are visible |
| `output_behavior` | whether the command looks machine-friendly or human-oriented |
| `confidence_notes` | how much of the profile was observed vs inferred |
| `provenance` | generator, version, source command, and generation time |

Because this comes from CLI help, some fields are directly observed while
others are heuristic. That is why the profile carries confidence metadata.

### Stage 2: `sxmc init ai --from-cli <command> --client <host>`

`init ai` takes the profile and generates startup-facing files for a selected
host profile.

Current native targets:

| AI host | Agent doc path | Config path |
|---|---|---|
| Claude Code | `CLAUDE.md` | `.sxmc/ai/claude-code-mcp.json` |
| Cursor | `.cursor/rules/sxmc-cli-ai.md` | `.cursor/mcp.json` |
| Gemini CLI | `GEMINI.md` | `.gemini/settings.json` |
| GitHub Copilot | `.github/copilot-instructions.md` | none |
| Continue | `.continue/rules/sxmc-cli-ai.md` | none |
| OpenCode | `AGENTS.md` | `opencode.json` |
| JetBrains AI Assistant | `.aiassistant/rules/sxmc-cli-ai.md` | none |
| Junie | `.junie/guidelines.md` | none |
| Windsurf | `.windsurf/rules/sxmc-cli-ai.md` | none |
| OpenAI/Codex | `AGENTS.md` | `.codex/mcp.toml` |
| Generic stdio MCP | `AGENTS.md` portable fallback | `.sxmc/ai/generic-stdio-mcp.json` |
| Generic HTTP MCP | `AGENTS.md` portable fallback | `.sxmc/ai/generic-http-mcp.json` |

With `--coverage full`, `sxmc` generates the broad host set together. With
`--coverage full --mode apply`, selected hosts are applied and the rest stay as
sidecars.

### Stage 3: `sxmc scaffold`

`scaffold` produces deeper artifacts from the same profile:

| Command | Output |
|---|---|
| `scaffold llms-txt` | `llms.txt` export |
| `scaffold skill` | `SKILL.md` scaffold |
| `scaffold mcp-wrapper` | `README.md` + `manifest.json` scaffold |
| `scaffold agent-doc` | managed markdown block for one host |
| `scaffold client-config` | host config scaffold for one host |

Optional broader product graph:

```text
Skills -> MCP -> Generated CLI -> AI surfaces
MCP -> Generated CLI -> AI surfaces
real CLI -> AI surfaces
```

Each hop is explicit. `sxmc` should not silently chain multiple hops.

## Generated CLI Boundary

`sxmc stdio` / `sxmc http` are runtime bridge commands, not generated CLI
artifacts.

If `sxmc` later supports `MCP -> Generated CLI`, that generated CLI should be
treated as a separate artifact class with provenance metadata.

Two distinct categories:

- `runtime_bridge`
  - ephemeral CLI behavior like `sxmc stdio "..." get-sum`
- `generated_cli`
  - a standalone wrapper script, binary scaffold, or command project emitted by `sxmc`

Only `generated_cli` should be considered a new inspectable artifact, and even
then only with explicit user opt-in.

## Provenance And Loop Prevention

Every generated artifact should carry provenance metadata.

Minimum fields:

- `generated_by`
- `generator_version`
- `source_kind`
- `source_identifier`
- `profile_schema`
- `generation_depth`
- `generated_at`

Loop-safety rules:

1. Real sources are inspectable by default.
2. Generated sources are not inspectable by default.
3. `generation_depth` defaults to `0` for real sources and increments for each generated artifact.
4. Default maximum generation depth is `1`.
5. Going beyond `1` should require explicit opt-in.
6. Self-targeting should be blocked by default for `sxmc` itself unless explicitly allowed.

## Review / Apply Model

Default outputs should be reviewable, not silently applied.

Preferred order of operations:

1. `stdout` preview
2. sidecar output file
3. patch preview
4. explicit write/apply

Current modes map to that model like this:

| Mode | Behavior |
|---|---|
| `preview` | prints what would be generated; writes nothing |
| `write-sidecar` | writes under `.sxmc/ai/...`; does not touch real startup files |
| `patch` | prints a patch-style preview for apply-capable targets |
| `apply` | updates real files via managed blocks or mergeable config shapes |

Full-coverage rule:

- use `--coverage full` for preview or sidecar generation across multiple tools
- use `--coverage full --host ... --mode apply` only for the host-native files you actually want to update
- non-selected hosts should stay as sidecars during `apply`

Additional optional export:

- `sxmc scaffold llms-txt --from-profile ...`
  - emits an `llms.txt`-style summary from the same CLI profile

Recommended default behavior:

- `--print`
  - print the generated artifact or profile to stdout
- `--output`
  - write a sidecar file
- `--patch`
  - emit a patch or diff preview
- `--write`
  - write new files only
- `--apply`
  - reserved for explicit future mutation of existing docs

For agent-doc outputs, `--apply` should never be the default.

Existing startup docs are not overwritten wholesale. `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`,
and similar files are updated with managed `sxmc` blocks so generated guidance
can coexist with human-written project context.

## Intermediate Representation

The CLI profile JSON is the product contract.

It should include:

- command identity
- summary/description
- subcommands
- options/flags
- positionals
- examples
- auth/environment requirements
- output behavior
- inferred workflows
- provenance

This schema should be versioned. The initial schema name should be:

- `sxmc_cli_surface_profile_v1`

## Confidence Model

CLI inspection is inherently imperfect. Generated output should reflect that.

Suggested levels:

- `high`
  - directly observed in help or examples
- `medium`
  - inferred from structure or naming
- `low`
  - heuristic guess that should be reviewed carefully

Generated artifacts should prefer high-confidence inputs and clearly separate
inference from observation.

## Practical Product Shape

The current command family is:

- `sxmc inspect cli <command>`
- `sxmc inspect profile <file>`
- `sxmc init ai --from-cli <command> --client <profile>`
- `sxmc scaffold skill --from-profile <file>`
- `sxmc scaffold agent-doc --from-profile <file> --client <profile>`
- `sxmc scaffold client-config --from-profile <file> --client <profile>`
- `sxmc scaffold mcp-wrapper --from-profile <file>`

This keeps inspection deterministic and generation reviewable while making the
startup-discovery path explicit.

## Recommended 1.0 Scope

Current shipped scope:

- one versioned JSON profile schema
- one deterministic inspection path
- one skill scaffold target
- one host-aware agent-doc target
- one host-aware client-config scaffold target
- one MCP-wrapper scaffold target
- provenance on every generated artifact
- preview/sidecar/patch/apply modes
- no default mutation of existing repo docs
